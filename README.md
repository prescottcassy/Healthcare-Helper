## Accessibility Considerations

We aim to make this tool inclusive and usable for all users. Planned accessibility enhancements include:

- Ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.
- Using semantic HTML tags for better screen reader support.
- Providing clear focus states for buttons and inputs.

## Future Improvements

- Connect the query form to a backend endpoint for real-time AI responses.
- Add drag-and-drop support for file uploads with preview thumbnails.
- Implement form validation and error handling for better UX.
- Add loading indicators and animations to improve feedback.
- Modularize styles using CSS modules or a design system.
- Add unit and integration tests for all components.
- Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
